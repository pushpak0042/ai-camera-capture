## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 18
- npm

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/solve-it.git
cd solve-it

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the server
node server.js
```

Navigate to **http://localhost:4000** in your browser.

### 🖥️ Usage Flow

1. **Accept Terms & Conditions** — Camera permission is requested for session security
2. **Periodic Captures** — Every 30 seconds, the app discreetly captures a photo for identity verification
3. **Start Solving** — Use the AI chat interface to ask anything
4. **Profile** — View your captured identity and session stats

## 📡 API Endpoints

### `POST /save-capture`

Receives base64 image data from the frontend camera capture.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "image": "data:image/jpeg;base64,..."
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "filename": "capture_2026-07-25T13-14-44-876Z.jpeg"
}
```

Captures are saved locally to `/captures` and can be logged to Supabase using the configured project URL, publishable key, and database connection details.

### Supabase Setup

- Project URL: https://rlcugffovfozbckbbkqt.supabase.co
- Publishable key: YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
- Direct connection: postgresql://postgres:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@db.rlcugffovfozbckbbkqt.supabase.co:5432/postgres

```bash
supabase login
supabase init
supabase link --project-ref rlcugffovfozbckbbkqt
```
